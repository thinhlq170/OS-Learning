# OS-Learning
- All excercises here are from Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces book.
- One of the most amazing books was recomended to me, it took me on a journey exploring operating system, thank to it I had some clues about process, stack structure, the way pointers handle memory operations.
- I have a good time with these exercises. Especially, wzip and unwzip programs gave me ideas about compression and decompression.
- Anyway, it's just a warm-up stage, there is a plenty of stuffs that need to be done.
